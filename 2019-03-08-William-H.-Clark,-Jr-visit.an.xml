          <p>I read about yesterday’s conference on Benefit Corporation legislation.</p>

          <p>Good.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That did generate some press. We’ll be on the record, and I’ll send you a transcript to edit for 10 days, and you can take out any part of it.</p>

        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>I assume I can edit freely.</p>

          <p>That’s right, edit freely, like completely freely.</p>

          <p>Completely rewrite history. It sounds like we’re in communist Russia or something.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s exactly right, but you can’t touch my part. It has to still make sense somehow. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>I probably should not edit your part.</p>

          <p>Never mind, we’re good.</p>

          <p>[laughs] How’s going for you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>I think we have a good gathering from all over the world. [laughs] It happened that we have a Italian lawyer here, and he study benefit corporation law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s great.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>He has been based in Milan and Taipei, so he can share his experience...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s awesome.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>Now we have both European and US experience to share, so we got more knowledgeable. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s awesome. There was two versions of benefit corporation law here...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>...domestically, around different sort of responsibilities, accountability criteria, and things like that. There was some internal debate that actually surfaced. I think Chu Ping raised some differences between the two versions. I was very curious how’s your take on all this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>We do not yet know how the differences between the two versions are going to be resolved, do we?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>The New Power Party’s version, I think they require...Professor Fang will come. He can explain that part. Basically, I think it’s a misunderstanding. New Power Party means they want if people didn’t get the benefit report disclosed, then there will be some...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Penalties?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>...penalties, or something like that. Ping thought that the government will check the inside content to see whether it’s followed the rule or not. Ping is against that part. I think it’s a misunderstanding because later we explained, &quot;Hey, New Power Party means they want people to disclose it, not have to have a government to check the content.&quot;</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Even if it’s 10 blank A4 pages, that’s going to be OK for government? Because we’re not going to look into content...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>Basically, government should not look into it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>If it’s 10 pages of comic sans, drawings or whatever...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>That is problem, right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>[laughs] That’s the problem of that company?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>If it’s entirely blank pages, that probably doesn’t work. It needs to be...</p>

          <p>Cartoons might work. You can actually do a report in cartoon fashion and say some substantive things.</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>I think it’s a good discussion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>It was a very good discussion. I don’t have a good feeling for how the politics is going to work out. That’s the real question. Of course, we are very interested in seeing it move along fairly quickly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>We’ve got some real sense of urgency. We think that it would be good for Taiwan if Taiwan can be the first Pacific Rim country to do this, too.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Is it possible at all to implement this at a regulation level, before it gets to the Parliament?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>I do not know enough about Taiwanese law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It is continental law system, same as Germany.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>A year ago, Ecuador proposed to do that. Ecuador actually wrote regulations that would be adopted by the superintendent of corporations in Ecuador. The lawyers that looked at it in Ecuador that we were working with said that they thought that that would be enforceable and would be an option.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>They actually proposed regulations. They formally published regulations in Ecuador, and then the government changed. Now they’ve introduced legislation, so they’re not going to do regulations. If you could do regulation right away...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>With 60 days of discussion, of course, but yeah.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>Then the only question would be would it be recognized as enforceable and be something that would be binding that the companies could rely on if they used it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right. A few differences: Regulation cannot introduce, in a continental law system, new penalties that is not mandated by the law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>On the other hand, we did put in quite a few provisions in the Company Act for the disclosure of the company’s incorporation documents, like the charter, as well as the right of minority shareholders to propose things that are for the public benefit if that is somehow recognized by the company in the first place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It all hinges on the disclosure of the intent. If we do publish a regulation that says, &quot;Oh, by the way, if an organization’s charter include a specific reference to a kind of templated language, then it is subject to this, this, this effects,&quot; I think that would be enforceable.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>That’s a very interesting idea. No one’s raised that issue in Taiwan before this morning. I think it would be preferable if we could get the legislation done.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>If we can’t, that’s an interesting alternative. Make a note. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>We should at least talk to Professor Fang.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Another possibility is the local policy level. Each city, each municipality can also make regulations or policies by its own. Of course, the drawback is that it may be fragmented, like every major city will introduce a different...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>Slightly different.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>...benefit corporation structure for the registered organizations.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>I think it would be preferable, if we went this way, to try to do it at the national level. When you set up a corporation in Taiwan, do you do that through the central government? Do you file your papers...?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>No, you file it through the local government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>Oh, OK.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>You need to have a register address, like a physical address, in a municipality, city or county. The city or municipality government takes the application.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>They actually file the documents?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Of course, the central registration database is in the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This actually is somewhat complicated now because you can also start a company online. When you file it online, then it’s actually directly to the MoEA, so it’s like...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>It’s already centralized?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>It’s different tracks, but the same database.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>If a member of the public wants to get a copy of the documents for a corporation, they go to the Central Ministry or do they go to...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>Depending on whether they’re a stakeholder. If they’re a stakeholder, they can legally go to either the MoEA or the local office and ask for a copy. If they’re not a stakeholder, they actually depend on the owner using a digital certificate to upload those documents to the MoEA website.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>The public does not have access to all of the records of a corporation...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>That’s right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>...without consent? That’s interesting. That’s different than the United States.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>I understand that. By law, the company is required to publish quite a few things online, but the articles of incorporation is not part of it; that’s opt-in.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>However, anyone can get a physical copy of that from the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>It’s interesting. Every country has their own system. [laughs]</p>

          <p>That’s right.</p>

          <p>I’m learning more and more about the...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>We have a central database, right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We have a central database.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>We can check the company name.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>You can do that in the central database, but you cannot get the copy of the document.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The founding documents is not available online by default.</p>

          <p>Right.</p>

          <p>No?</p>

          <p>No, it’s by voluntary disclosure.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>I’m intrigued by the notion of regulations. We should investigate that.</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>Who would write those regulations? The ministry?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, certainly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#William H. Clark Jr">
          <p>They’re busy at the moment writing a report to Congress already on this.</p>

          <p>Regulation is within our purview, but legislation needs the MPs.</p>

        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The legislation is entirely in the Parliament. Even if we present a draft bill, it will most likely get scheduled for the next year. It can’t be fast-tracked through the legislation this year.</p>

        <speech by="#Ray Chen">
          <p>How it will be called, 條例 or what’s the...?</p>

        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>As long as it’s enforceable, there’s no difference really. As we see recently, our draft bill for marriage equality to the legislation was a separate act because the referendum says that it cannot change the existing civil code.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>We sent a new act for marriage equality that basically says, for a marriage relationship between same-sex individuals, see civil code, see civil code, see civil code for the rights and obligations. That’s the &quot;Enforcement Act of Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 748&quot;, nicknamed the hyperlink act...</p>

          <p>It’s a technicality. Outside of the Company Act, we can still basically write anything that we would have written in the Company Act. It makes no difference. That’s, I think, what Dr. Chen Mei-ling point out yesterday.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
          <p>The same goes for laws. The real point is whether the public service is on our side. If the public service, in general, is on our side, then regulations tends to be very stable. Minister-level people can’t really change a regulation at will if the public service say, &quot;Oh, our operation depends on it.&quot;</p>

          <p>There is a version, but it’s an act that pertains to the social enterprises in general, without saying anything about the structure. It may be a co-op, it may be a company, or a charity. What it looks at is an earned income percentage.</p>
